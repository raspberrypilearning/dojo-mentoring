legend: Question 3 of 3
---

There are ten minutes left in the Dojo session. All of the children are getting loud and excited. You promised one Ninja that he could show his project at “show and tell” at the end. Everyone is distracted and the room is getting louder. The Ninja is getting embarrassed that nobody seems interested in their project. What would be the best action to take?


--- choices ---

- ( ) Tell him to present to the noisy group.

  --- feedback ---
This is likely to make the child feel uncomfortable; that what he has done isn’t worth people's attention. They will likely be reluctant to share their project again.

- ( ) Wrap up the session early, and announce you are finishing early because they were chatting.

  --- feedback ---

Dojos are informal, fun, and collaborative spaces. Young people chatting and getting excited about what they are doing should be seen as a positive, while also encouraging them to be respectful of others. Instead, you should try and encourage those who are louder to get involved in the show and tell.

- (x) Announce to the group that the show and tell is starting, and ask those who were chatting to participate as well.

  --- feedback ---

When getting young people's attention by announcing that show and tell is starting, note the importance of respecting the presenters by listening. Including one or more of the chatting children will mean they are given an outlet and it also means they won't be chatting during the presentation.

- ( ) Present on behalf of the Ninja

  --- feedback ---
This is likely to make the child feel like he can’t present himself and undermine his confidence. Instead, focus on getting the attention of the group so the space is quiet enough for children to present.
