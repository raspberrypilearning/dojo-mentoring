## Common programming languages in Dojos

The most commonly used programming languages used in Dojos are Scratch, HTML and CSS, and Python. Mentors are not expected to know these languages when they start at a Dojo. However, learning a little about each will help develop your knowledge and confidence in a Dojo setting.

  <span style="color: #0faeb0">**Remember:** You don't need to be an experienced coder to mentor at a Dojo.</p>


## Scratch
<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Scratch** is a block-based, drag-and-drop style coding language with a simple visual interface. It promotes creativity, computational thinking, and problem solving skills. </p>
Scratch is particularly great for beginners and younger children as they can see the impact of their code quickly, without worrying about typing or remembering names and syntax. It is free, available online, offline, and in more than 70 languages.

**What can you make with it?**
Young people can create digital stories, games, and animations in Scratch.

## HTML and CSS
<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**HTML and CSS** are used to structure and style webpages. They are the building blocks of every webpage on the internet. </p> 
Suitable for children who have some experience typing, these languages can provide a good, visual introduction to web development for those who have the patience for a little problem solving.

**What can you make with it?**
Young people can make and style websites with multiple webpages.

## Python
<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Python** is a text-based coding language. It is one of the most popular programming languages because of its readability, and similarities to written English, making it easier to understand than other programming languages. </p>
It is suitable for older children who have some typing skills.

**What can you make with it?**
Python is used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation.
