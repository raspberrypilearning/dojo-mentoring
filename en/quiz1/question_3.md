legend: Question 3 of 3
---

A young child who is new to the Dojo says *"I can’t think of a project idea."* How do you respond?

--- choices ---

- ( ) "I'll give you an idea!"


  --- feedback ---
Avoid giving a Ninja your own ideas. It might not be something they are interested in or relevant to their experiences. Encourage them to think for themselves using prompting questions.

- ( ) "You're a boy so you must like football. Make a football themed project"


  --- feedback ---
Avoid making assumptions about what a young person is interested in based on their gender, appearance or other traits. It’s important to encourage Ninja's own ideas. You may need to act as a catalyst to help draw those ideas out. You can suggest broad topics like "Food" or "Activities" and let them brainstorm topics related to things they are interested in.

- ( ) "Play a video game until you've thought of something to make."


  --- feedback ---
Avoid encouraging young people to passively play video games in the Dojo. The Dojo is a space for creating. Instead, ask the young person questions to draw out what kind of project they could make.

- (x) "What kind of things would you like to make? We can look through our Project's website and see what you might like to create."


  --- feedback ---
Ask questions about their interests to help encourage them to come up with their own ideas. Looking at our project examples can help them decide the kind of project they'd like to make.
