## Group management and expectation setting
Dojos aren’t formal education settings. It’s important that sessions are enjoyable and fun for all those involved. A good way to ensure this is to set expectations early. Encourage parents or guardians to read the [code of behaviour](https://help.coderdojo.com/cdkb/s/article/Code-of-Behaviour-volunteers){:target="_blank"} with children before attending. You can highlight the ethos of the CoderDojo in your venue with our [motto posters](https://help.coderdojo.com/cdkb/s/article/Dojo-Motto-Posters){:target="_blank"}. 

--- task ---
Involve young people in developing a code of conduct for the Dojo at the start of each term. If young people feel involved in setting the rules, they are more likely to follow them.
--- /task ---

It is important for volunteers to take responsibility for promoting good and courteous behaviour themselves during the Dojo too. 

--- task ---
Use praise consistently and fairly, i.e. avoid favouritism.

Involve and motivate young people by discussing and supporting them with projects appropriate to their needs and experience.

--- task ---
Talk with the parent or guardian if particularly disruptive behaviour occurs during a session. The child may be frustrated with a project, reacting to an external stressor, or have additional needs that are not being supported.
