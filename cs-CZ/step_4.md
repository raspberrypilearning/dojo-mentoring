Coding can help young people to participate in and shape a rapidly changing world. It's important that learning materials present computing as a career that is open to all and avoid historic stereotypes related to computing. This includes how topics are presented, as well as the language and media assets chosen to introduce them.

Our learning materials are designed to be inclusive. Care should be taken when using other materials.

Promotional materials for your Dojo, learning materials, and mentoring approaches should promote *equity* and ensure that learners can see themselves represented through computing.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Equity** refers to fair and just practices and policies that ensure all people thrive. Equity acknowledges and addresses inequalities that advantage some and disadvantage others.</p>

Culturally responsive pedagogy emphasises the importance of including and valuing all creators’ knowledge, ways of learning, vernacular culture and heritage.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Vernacular culture** is the cultural forms made and organised by ordinary, often indigenous people, as distinct from the high culture of an elite.</p>

Culturally relevant pedagogy promotes the development of creators’ critical consciousness of the world and encourages them to ask questions about ethics, power, privilege, and social justice. It emphasises opportunities to address issues that are important to Ninja's and their communities.


### Culturally responsive mentoring practices include:
+ Drawing on young peoples’ cultural knowledge and experiences to inform their learning
+ Providing opportunities for Ninja's to choose personally meaningful projects and to express their own cultural identities
+ Exploring issues of social justice and bias
+ Using equitable guidance approaches, such as open-ended, inquiry-led activities and discussion-based collaborative tasks
+ Providing inclusive representations of a range of cultures, and making sure learning materials are accessible

## Accessibility practices for Dojos
At your Dojo, you will have lots of different participants, including participants with disabilities and/or additional needs. You can help make a Dojo more accessible through listening to your participants, making reasonable adjustments, and deciding what works best, so that they can have the best possible CoderDojo experience.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Everyone’s needs and abilities will be different, and this goes for all members of your Dojo — not just those with a disability.</p>

--- task ---

Keep channels of communication open. Actively listen to members of your Dojo, and discuss together how you can best support their participation.

--- /task ---

Learn more about approaches you can use in your Dojo to make it more accessible for participants with disabilities and/or additional needs in our guide.

And remember, not all disabilities or additional needs are visible.
