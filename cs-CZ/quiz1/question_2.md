legend: Question 2 of 3
---

An older Ninja asks you during a session *“Can I try something a bit harder? I have got the hang of this now.”* How do you respond?

- (x) "Sure, we can look for some content that builds on this. Is there anything you really want to try to do?"

  --- feedback --- When appropriate, encourage Ninjas to stretch themselves by giving them a new target to reach for. Asking for their suggestions also makes sure that it continues to be relevant to their interests.

In addition, you could encourage them to share what they've learned with the wider group. This helps confirm they understand the concepts and it develops the Ninja's presentation skills. It also helps the wider group learn more collaboratively.
