legend: Question 2 of 3
---

A Ninja is working on a project. She is using JavaScript and wants a hidden box to appear when the mouse hovers over it. You have used Scratch, but have no idea about JavaScript! What do you do?


--- choices ---

- ( ) Pretend you know what she needs to do but tell her she needs to figure it out herself.

  --- feedback --- Mentoring isn’t about knowing everything. In fact, it is helpful for young people to know it’s okay not to have all the answers and that even mentors are learning too.


  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Use a search engine (e.g. Google) yourself and then tell the Ninja.

  --- feedback ---

Instead, use this as an opportunity to show the Ninja how to use a search engine to find the solution themselves. This will help them develop the skills to solve similar issues in future.


  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Tell the Ninja to try something else.

  --- feedback ---

This can be disheartening for a Ninja who has been working through a project. Instead, you could ask the Ninja to look for a similar project on our projects website to see if it includes a similar feature that they could use to resolve their issue.



  --- /feedback ---

- (x) Admit you don’t know and support them to find the answer.

  --- feedback ---

This can be by helping them look up the answer on a search engine, asking their peers, finding a similar project online, asking other mentors, and preparing in advance for similar JavaScript projects in the future. Use it as a learning moment for yourself and the wider group.
