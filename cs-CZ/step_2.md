## Group management and expectation setting
Dojos aren’t formal education settings. It’s important that sessions are enjoyable and fun for all those involved. A good way to ensure this is to set expectations early. Encourage parents or guardians to read the [code of behaviour](https://help.coderdojo.com/cdkb/s/article/Code-of-Behaviour-volunteers){:target="_blank"} with children before attending. You can highlight the ethos of the CoderDojo in your venue with our [motto posters](https://help.coderdojo.com/cdkb/s/article/Dojo-Motto-Posters){:target="_blank"}.

--- task --- Involve young people in developing a code of conduct for the Dojo at the start of each term. If young people feel involved in setting the rules, they are more likely to follow them. --- /task ---

It is important for volunteers to take responsibility for promoting good and courteous behaviour themselves during the Dojo too.

--- task --- Use praise consistently and fairly, i.e. avoid favouritism.

--- /task ---

--- task --- Involve and motivate young people by discussing and supporting them with projects appropriate to their needs and experience.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Parents or guardians of Ninjas under 12 should be present at the Dojo. 
</p>

--- task --- Talk with the parent or guardian if particularly disruptive behaviour occurs during a session. The child may be frustrated with a project, reacting to an external stressor, or have additional needs that are not being supported. --- /task ---
