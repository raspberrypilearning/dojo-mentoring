### Mentor input and involvement in sessions
It's important that you have a great experience volunteering with CoderDojo. It is helpful if you share with the champion or other mentors what your interests and motivations are, this will help ensure:
+ Your role is fulfilling
+ You are performing tasks that are interesting to you
+ Ideas for adaptations that could be beneficial to volunteers and the wider Dojo are discussed and acted on
