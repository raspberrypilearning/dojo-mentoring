## Showcasing and reflection

A “show and tell”, where young people share what they are working on at the end of a session, is a great way to develop their presentation and public speaking skills.

There are a variety of ways to do this. Projects can be presented on a screen, young people can gather around a Ninja's laptop or a projecter can be used. ![Examples of young people showcasing their projects. Image credit to : @yukiko_kikuchi, @SandraMaguire and @arucoderdojo](images/Showcase.png)

Asking Ninjas to showcase their projects shows that you recognise the effort they have made and that you believe that they have something of value to share with others.

Encourage the Ninjas to listen and clap after another Ninja has shared a project. This helps ensure that the presenter has a positive experience.

End of year project showcases or larger showcases like [Coolest Projects](https://online.coolestprojects.org/) can also be very rewarding for mentors, as you get to see how your support has helped Ninjas progress and learn.

## Reflecting on learnings
Encouraging learners to revisit the important learnings from the project solidifies new knowledge and provides opportunities for mastery. We provide opportunities for this in our [new project paths](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths).


--- task ---

Encourage reflection by asking questions of young people, such as:
+ What does this piece of code do?
+ How did you do that?
+ What would happen if you tried … instead?
+ What would you do differently if you were starting the project again?
